# SPH029 - Machine Learning
MSc Health Data Analytics w/ Machine Learning

My first Python machine learning project during the Machine Learning module of the MSc Health Data Analytics course (taught by Dr Seth Flaxman)


Data source: [A merged lung cancer transcriptome dataset for clinical predictive modelling - Su Bin Lim et al. (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018136)


## Overview
The aim of this project is to explore the use of machine learning for the prediction of lung cancer. 
In particular, I will apply different machine learning techniques on microarray expression levels from a lung cancer transcriptome dataset[^1] in
order to classify Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. The project broadly consists of two main tasks - an unsupervised task and a supervised task - 
which are described as follows:

#### Unsupervised Learning
Identify the NSCLC disease subtypes using gene expression levels using:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

#### Supervised Learning
Compare and contrast the performance of classic machine learning algorithms for the classification of NSCLC cases. Models used:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
